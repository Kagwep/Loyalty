                                            <p className='italic text-xl'>"Loyalty" is a 3D immersive strategy game that challenges players to manage resources, deploy units, and conquer their opponents. Set in a mythical world, players command armies made up of various unit typesâ€”each with unique abilities. What makes "Loyalty" unique is its blend of dynamic battles, NFT integration, and a competitive leaderboard system, offering a deep strategic experience.</p>

                                            <p className='italic text-xl'>The game features two sides: Player One (room creator) and Player Two (joiner). Each player commands army units including cavalry, infantry, archers, and artillery. Each unit type has different strengths (cavalry - 4, infantry - 3, archers - 2, artillery - 1) and it's crucial to manage these units wisely. Players engage by moving their units so that their "threat area" touches or collides with an opponent unit, reducing their strength based on the engagement outcome.</p>
